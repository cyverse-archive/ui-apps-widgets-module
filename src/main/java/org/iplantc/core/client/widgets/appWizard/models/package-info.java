/**
 * XXX JDS At this point, these models are turning into non-simple autobeans.
 * Why?
 * In order to create the widget form panel, we need not only the data which describes which fields are
 * to be displayed, but also the value which the field will be getting from the user. So there is a "value" 
 * field which is required to keep the UI side clear (only want to construct from one data model, not a base
 * data model AND a data model which wraps the base data model).
